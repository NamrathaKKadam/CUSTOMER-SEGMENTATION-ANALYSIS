🧩 Customer Segmentation Analysis – Streamlit Web App
📘 Project Overview

This project performs Customer Segmentation using Data Analytics and Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering) to analyze customer demographics, purchase history, and engagement data.
The goal is to identify distinct groups of customers to enable targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and data-driven business strategies.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Marketing Analytics: Customer Segmentation

Format: CSV / Excel

Dataset Features:
